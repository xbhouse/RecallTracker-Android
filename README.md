<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This project was a mobile platform solution using Fortellis' Open Safety Recall API endpoint for CDK Global's 2019 Hackathon. This application also utilizes the NHTSA's VIN Decoder API to gather information on a vehicle based on its VIN.</p>

<p>The application also implements a Push Notification service using the Firebase Cloud Messaging Service. The repository for the backend server can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/SuperCheese21/safety-recall-server">safety-recall-server repository</a>.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Please make sure that you have at least Android Studio (version 3.5) and proper Android SDK versions for your device installed and running correctly on your machine. For more information, please take a look at the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html">Android Studio documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Now just clone the project into your local machine and run it!</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> In order for the Push Notifications to work, you will need to clone from the <a href="https://github.com/SuperCheese21/safety-recall-server">safety-recall-server repository</a> and set up your own Firebase Cloud Messaging service.</p>
